        <div class="intro-text">
            <p class="p1">Welcome to Guided Meditation Dojo. We are going to introduce 3 guided meditations
            specially designed for the beginners. 1st Meditation is mere ground work, it is going to 
            teach you how to get into the present moment and maintain it. 
            We recommend you to practice each meditation on daily basis for a month before moving
            to a following one. 
            </p>
            <p class="p2">We also advise you to practice the skills you learn in the meditations throughout the 
            day, as they due to the consitent repetition will become habitual in 3-5 weeks. At first,
            start applying them during the 
            passive activities such as brushing your teeth, washing dishes, cooking, walking, running, etc. 
            Instead of letting your mind wonder to 3 different timelines, hundreds of different events;
            use that time to guide your mind to the present moment and see for how long can you maintain it.
            </p>
            <p class="p3">Once you develop this awareness to a certain degree, you will start getting a glimpses of
            when you're not present and aware, you will notice when you react and do things in an auto-pilot
            mode, because of becoming aware of your unconscious behaviors and habits, you get the chance to 
            change them. Scary as it sounds, it is the path to improved and more present life.
            </p>
            <p class="p4">In the 2nd and 3rd Meditation, you're going to build the new skills on top of the existing ones.
            Considering you have already mastered getting into the present moment by active listening
            and observing your breath, you have decresed unconscious reaction to a certain stimuli
            from inside and outside world by observing your thoughs and emotions.</p>
            <p class="p5">
            You are now ready to start feeling and sensing. In the 2nd Meditation you will be guided to 
            feel your body, each part of it, and by doing this you will increase the body awareness which
            will further fuel your ability to snap back into the present moment and stay present for a longer
            periods of time. While in the 3rd Meditation you will be guided to sense the space around you, and 
            to sense the space that your body occupies in space. The reason you're going to build this skill
            is so that your Neocortex - the analytical brain quietens down. 
            Let us explain you why. When you place your primary focus on the breathing and secondary
            focus on hearing, feeling your body, sensing the space and seeing the blackness in front of your
            closed eyes, your analytical mind will shut down. No more inner critiq, no more judgement, 
            you're in the sweet spot of that generous present moment. 
            And now, now is the time to teach your body emotionally what does it feel like
            living as the best version of yourself. It's the time to create, at this point the 
            inside world becomes more real than the outiside world.
            And this is what we call a journey of transformation!
