        <div id="intro-text">
            <p class="p1">Welcome to The Alexander Technique Dojo. Here you will  find the information required for you to get 
                a little glimpse into the technique and hopefully have a successful start. Also, further down the page 
                there will be guided video session which will guide you through the laying part of the technique.</p>
            <p class="p2">We cannot recommend you enough to try to find a teacher who can guide you through the first few 
                weeks. Why does the teacher make the whole process easier? Well, the first reason is that the teacher 
                can recognize your improper use of yourself and aid you in changing this habitual misuse by giving you 
                a sensory experience of the new use which won't feel right at first, and that is the second reason. 
                It is really hard to find that sweet spot when something feels off, and yes, it is meant to feel off 
                because you’re not used to it. This work calls necesarelly for the acceptance of the unknown into your 
                sensory experience. And the third reason is that the sensory experience can hardly be conveyed by written 
                or spoken word so that it means the same to a pupil what it means to a teacher.</p>
            <p class="p3">The teacher can give you that boost in the beginning which will save so much of your time practicing and 
                trying to make things right, which, is a mistake in itself. Trying to make things right will bring more 
                wrong into the game. When you trying to do anything, you just add to the muscular tension, and you make 
                the things worse. Trying to get the things “right” only reinforces more “known” and you cannot lead to 
                “right“ when the “right” is yet unknown. Therefore, take our advice and find yourself a local teacher!</p>
            <p class="p4">The Alexander Technique is about giving the mental directions and about preventing the habitual misuse. 
                It sounds simple but it is a long process. It requires daily practice and repetition. And it needs to be 
                spread in the other activities in order for you to reap all the benefits that the technique provides.</p>
            <p class="p5">First step in the technique is called a Primary control. It is of a supreme importance for psycho-physical 
                functioning. Primary control is a relationship between head, neck and body which influences whole body posture 
                and position.  To maintain the lengthening of the spine, the head must be put forward and up in such a way that 
                the back lengthens and widens, and this requires no active doing. It is purely mental. Teacher usually advises 
                pupils to use their imagination in order set a primary control in place. 
            </p>
            <p class="p6"> To change the habitual use first you must give yourself the primary control directions and then refuse to do 
                anything immediately in response. Let say you want to pick up a cup and drink out of it. Before acting on it, 
                you have to give yourself first part of the directions many times before attempting to this immerse in this 
                new experience. It is necessary to give yourself directions of the first part while giving yourself directions 
                of the second part and so on. If we take for an example giving the directions to move the head forward and out, 
                you must keep directing yourself to do so and once you’re satisfied with the result, you start giving yourself 
                the second set of direction of moving your shoulders sideways in such a way that the back lengthens and widens 
                while still giving the directions to your head and neck region. This is called a combined process of giving the directions.  
            </p>
            <p class="p7">To begin making the changes you desire, you need to allow these new ways of use to be dominated by the reasoning 
                instead of feeling, especially at the crucial moment such as merging the directioning into doing. Habitual use 
                will usually have a comfortable feeling, and the key is to follow the untrustworthy feeling in order to avoid 
                wrong, habitual use of oneself.</p> 
                
                <p class="p8">The help of the teacher comes in handy at this point, because once the pupil has inhibited the instinctive misdirection 
                that have led him to the faulty habitual use, the teacher then begins the process of building up this new use by giving 
                the pupil the proper primary direction.  The pupil then will carry out this direction while the teacher with their hands 
                makes sure the pupil stays in this new unknown feeling of use. Although it is unknown at the beginning, it becomes 
                familiar after it has been carried out time and time again. Eventually pupil gets to the point where they’re confident 
                enough to perform it on their own and continue practicing correctly in the comfort of their home.</p> 
                
                <p class="p9">For those who practice on their own, we are going to return to the example with the cup and the act of drinking. We 
                mentioned how you need to give yourself the direction many times before you perform an action. Now once you get to 
                that moment of merging into doing, you keep repeating the same process before you feel ready and sure you can maintain 
                directioning while you engage into an action. This means working against the habit you have created and carried out your 
                whole life, anyone who have tried knows how hard is to work against the habits. The difficulty in this case is 
                significantly increased when it comes to end gaining, performing the action. Because you have to be constantly observant, 
                give yourself the new directions which will feel wrong, inhibit the instinctive actions and continue giving the new 
                reasoned ones many times before performing the act.</p>  
                
                <p class="p10">The process is slow and can be tedious, but once you become familiar with the proper use of oneself, the ball starts 
                rolling. This doesn’t mean you will stop working in a slow, deliberately planned step-by-step process, it means you 
                will understand what and why so that the how become easier. The gradual improvement that will come out of the determined 
                practice will give you the ability to become more and more aware of your faulty habitual patterns. It is then very 
                important to start observing your physical and mental habits caused by reaction to the particular stimulus because 
                keeping the track of them will speed up the process of removing them.</p>  
                
                <p class="p11">With the improvement in the use of oneself and with the adjustment of different parts of your body, there will also come
                an improvement in the manner of reacting to stimuli in every sphere of activity. You will become more present and 
                resilient, in other words, you will have a strong grip on your wheel. Let’s get little deeper into that; If you inhibit 
                your immediate instinctive reaction to any stimulus, you have a choice to prevent the misdirection of your use which is 
                associated with muscle tension and other physical and mental aliments, you will then have at your command a means of 
                controlling the nature of your reaction. This control is called a conscious behavior.</p> 
                
                <p class="p12">It all comes down to reasoning. And as Alexander said in his book: “Reasoning is our great ally in the quest for truth.”</p>
