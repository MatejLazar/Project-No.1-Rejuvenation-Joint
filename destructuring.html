                <p class="p1"> Here you will be introduced to 15 different postures
                    which after carried out correctly will bring the deep relaxation to the whole muscular system.</p>
                <p class="p2"> You will be asked to spend atleast 20 seconds in each posture, breathing in for 5,
                    holding
                    for 5, breathing out for 5 and then holding for another 5 seconds.!</p>
                <p class="p3"> It is completely fine to spend more than 5 seconds on each section of the particular
                    posture,
                    reducing your time down from 5 seconds will definitelly decrease the potential benefits.
                    It is highly recomended to exhale on the most difficult parts of the stretch, and with the breath
                    go deeper into the stretch, that way the pain will be more berable and you will be able to
                    stretch further.</p>
                <p class="p4"> Destructuring sequence can server better than a strong cup of coffe. Morning session will
                    energize you and get you ready for the day, plus you will have a little victory under your belt.
                    One must have a quite strong power of will to do it first thing in the morning, as Mark Twain
                    famously said: "If the first thing you do in the morning is eat a live frong, you can go through
                    the rest of the day knowing the worst is behind you." Your frog is your worst task, or maybe even
                    the task you will most certainly procrastinate and eventually skip as the day progresses.
                </p>
                <p class="p5"> Visulisation plays an enormous role in each of the postures, and is of a great benefit in
                    each
                    field of life too. Practicing visualiation and by training your imagination here in the
                    Destructuring
                    Dojo, you will develop the great skill which you will be able to use while performing other tasks,
                    and by doing so, your performance is going to increase significantly.
                </p>
                <p class="p6"> Below you will find all 15 postures thoroguly explained, and near the end of the page,
                    there is
                    a 12 minute video session awaiting you. We recommend you to follow the video, but as soon as you
                    memorise the postures and get comfotable with the movement try to do it on your own, and follow the
                    most
                    suitable breathing patter. Some of the most advanced Destructurers exercise 4x10sec method.

                <p>To advance in this exercise, you need to make sure to keep stretching the leg forward and

                <p>To achieve full potential of this exercise, you must imagine the front knee being pushed

                <p>An advanced practicioners can place the rear knee on the floor and imagine the pelvic gridle
                    meeting the floor. Once you reach the deepest stretch, place the closer hand onto your knee,
                    and twist the back while slightly pushing the hand into the knee.

                <p>From "Curlicue" you lock your body with "Latch" by twisting the rear foot on the side. You
                    no longer keep the keep the body weight on the front knee, instead, you move your upper body to
                    the center of the posture and allow the pelvis to slowly drop down toward the floor.</p>
                <p>In order to perform this, or any other posture perfectly, the use of the imagination is a
                    sheer necessity. In this case you need to give yourself four mental directionings by imagioning
                    knee being pushed forward and up, rear foot being pulled in the opposite direction and having
                    an extra weight being placed on the top of your pelvis while simoultaneously having a head and neck
                    being pulled towards the ceeling by an invisible string.
                </p>
                <p>It is perfectly fine to give yourself first two directions, and as you grow your ability to maintain
                    the multi focus, you can then add third and forth direction.

                <p>To get into "Mantis Chill" posture, you begin by standing straight in a wide stance, direct your

                    alignment with the pelvis. Once you reach the limit, the imagination and conscious directioning
                    starts
                    playing their part.
                </p>
                <p>To get that little extra out of this posture, you imagine the each knee flowing in it's direction
                    towards the side walls and your pelvic floor sinking to the ground.

                <p>In "Lotus" you just sit down and connect the feet together. The key to perform this exercise
                    correctly is to pull the heels all the way to your crotch. Depending on the level of your
                    flexibility push the knees down to your limit. When you reach the point of the deepest stretch,
                    allow your body to move forward gaining even deeper strech and then hold.
                </p>
                <p>This posture doens't require the imagination to be used, you can simply follow the
                    instructions to reach the point of maxiumum streatch and the as you ehale go that extra mile,
                    face the pain and hold.

                    your body into a letter "L", next you slightly bend your knees and grab the arch of your beet.
                    Now here is the trick; you got to pull down the feet while simoultaneously pushing your hands
                    away with the force of the legs.
                </p>
                <p>Mostly all of the postures when performed correctly and in depth should produce tremour.
                    Like in the previous posture, there is not much imagination you can do except
                    imagine your bottom being pulled away from the direction you push your hands towards.

            <div class="explanation" id="right">
                <p>Just like a "Dying Cockroach" this posture begins by laying on your back. First you
                    thrust both legs over your head while maintaining the balance on very top of your back. The
                    neck and head also play a role of a balancing variable in this posture. Once you have reached
                    the crux of "Californian Wave", you have to focus on straightening your legs by pushing the
                    heels toward the back wall while imagioning your bottom moving in the opposite direction.
                </p>
                <p>It is much easier to get a tremour in this posture than in any other, so we recommend you
                    to practice it as a stand-alone exercise just to get the feeling of proper tremour. It is
                    enough to stay in tremour for 3 seconds to gain the benefits of deep muscle relaxation.

                <p>"The Clock" is the third posture that begins by laying on your back. What differentiates
                    this posture from previous two is that you don't lift the legs as before, but instead you bring
                    your knees as close to your chest as possible, and from this point twist the hips on the side while
                    keeping your upper back straight on the ground. The next step is to stretch the top leg.
                <p>When you reach the maximum stretch use the visulisation technique and think you heel and bottom
                    into the opposite directions. Repeat the same steps for the other side.

                <p>Unlike in the previous postures, this one begins by laying flat on the stomach. First you must
                    bend you knees and take a grip of the bridge of you feet, then lift the chest off the floor while
                    simoultaneously pushing your hands away with the force of the legs. To reach the maximum potential
                    of the stretch this posture provides you have to imagine your chest moving toward the front wall
                    while your shoulders are moving away in the opposite direction.

                    you stretch your back and spine by slowly arching your lower and upper back like a cat. On the
                    the exale, drop your chest abruptly. The next step is to allow the chest to sink further down.
                    Imagine it as though the chest is seperating from the rest of the body. Your head and neck
                    should be relaxed and hanging. At this point you should feel a very deep stretch around
                    shoulderblades. The key is to move deeper into the pain.

                    way from the floor, reach with one arm underneath the oppsite pitarm and keep stretching it further.
                    Imagine the arm moving futher away even though you think you have reached your limit, allow your
                    torso to twist as you're moving the arm away from you. This stretch is so good for your spine. You

                <p>"Blourney Stone" is a great posture in so many ways. It is easu to perform and you get to
                    the deep stretch quickly and it hits different areas of your body. The main stretch occurs in
                    the hips, chest, shoulders, front of the neck and underchin muscle. All you have to do is to kneel
                    down and reach for Achilies tendon. The next step is to move hips and chest toward the front wall
                    and
                    allow head to hang back.</p>
                <p>To reach the deeper stretch use the technique of visalisation as in the previous postures.
                    Imagine the chest moving up and away from your body.

                <p>"Blue Blooded Baboon" can be dismantled into three section. Groundwork, hang, and rise.
                    In ground work one has to stand straight and bend enough to place palms flat on the floor.
                    You are allowed to bend your need little bit too.</p>
                <p>Once you have got into the monkey pose, push your bottom up and away at about 90 degree
                    angle while maintaining the hands on the ground. Try to relax the body in the spite of pain. </p>
                <p>When you breathe out, remove your hands from the ground, place them on your elbows, straighten the
                    legs and simply hang. The trick here is to release all the tension and move deeper into the
                    stretch.</p>
                <p>The final part of this posture is the rise, you slowly rise up vertebra by vertebra.</p>

                <div class="card14">
                </div>
                <div class="wrapped">
                    <p>"FG Bents" is perhaps the most difficult exercuse on the list, but once you get a hang of it
                        it won't be as troublesome as it might be on the beginning. </p>
                    <p>The first step is to stand in a narrow stance, feet together. Stretch you arms
                        toward the ceeling with a finger-gun gesture. The trick here is to imagine lats,
                        shoulders and arms being pulled away in sky while everything else is falling through
                        the ground. When you reach that deep stretch, send your hips to one side and lean sideways
                        in an opposite direction. You have to make sure you don't twist the torso as you bend, Keep
                        it nice and parralel with the front wall. You also got to keep sending the arms and lats
                        away through the whole process. </p>
                    <p class="exc">Once you reach the point of the maximum stretch, stay there for a few seconds, focus
                        on your breath while still having the focus on the directions you're giving to yourself.
                        Slowly return to the starting position and do the same for the other side.</p>
                    <p class="exc">The second step is to bend backwards. A very important tip here is to avoid putting
                        the pressure on the lower-back. You use very little of lower-back movement just in order
                        to find the focal point in the middle of your torso.
                    </p>
                    <p class="exc">This might sound little bit confusing, but the consitant practice will get you there.
                        From that focal point you band backward while simoultaneously pushing the front of the
                        focal point forward. When you reach your limit, slowly rise up into the starting position.
                    </p>
                    <p class="exc">Now as a final step, you're going to stretch your arms once again the same way as
                        before
                        but this time, lean forward. When you get to a 90 degree angle, with the power of imagionation
                        stretch the arms further and push the pelvis backwards. On the exale, drop the arms, bend one
                        knee and bounce against the pressure. Swap the knees and do repeat.
                    </p>
                    <p class="exc">Finally squat down into a deep squat with your feet flat on the ground, allow your
                        back to
                        go forward into the strech. Imagine your head and spine moving into the ground.</p>

                <p>"Nexflex" is j a boundle of neck stretches which will definitelly turn your life around
                    if you have a stiff neck or any beck pain.
                </p>
                <p>First get into the standard lotus position, cross legged. Then stretch both arms sideways
                    and touch the floor with the tips of your fingers. The next step is to turn your head to the
                    side until you reach the limit. Ideally you chin will be in line with the shoulder, now slightly
                    tilt your head toward the floor and keep pushing with very little force against the pressure.
                    slowly return your head to a starting position and do the same for the other side.
                </p>
                <p class="exc">In the second part of "NeckFlex" you will tilt your head in a way that you come as close
                    to your shoulder with the ear as possible, hold it there and on the exale place your hand over
                    the head and allow the gravity to do it's work. Do the same for the other side and finally,
                    let your head hang forward, place both hand over the back of your head and let the gravity pull
                    it down. In each of these stretches it is very usefull to focus on the pain and allow yourself to
                    "go"
                    with it. To imagine you're diving deeper into it.
